I am having a issue when i start a qlik sense enterprise versions the repository service stop after few seconds.
i look in to logs (C:\ProgramData\Qlik\Sense\Log\Repository\System\) of qlik sense there i found an issue (ResultText=Error: Failed to initialize usage of Windows Performance Counters. Make sure that performance counters are enabled or try rebuilding them with "lodctr /R")


++++++Solution++++
I run cmd as Administrator
and run following command:
"lodctr /R"

by running above command i restart my qlik sense services and now its working perfectly
